  |   A new challenger has appeared in the platform fighter arena!          |
  |   Brawlout is the party fighting game, designed for couch play,         |
  |   online matches and competitive tournaments.                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Brawlout packs a punch with couch and online play modes, blending     |
  |   platform fighter mechanics and traditional fighting game play into    |
  |   a stylish and fluid battle royale.                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Rather than slow-paced defensive battles, Brawlout goes all-out       |
  |   with the lightning-fast aerobatics which platform fighters are        |
  |   famous for.                                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Striking the balance between the growing competitive scene and the    |
  |   genre's party game roots, Brawlout hopes to cater to the veteran      |
  |   platform fighter, the casual fan and the newcomer looking to make     |
  |   their mark.                                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Each character in Brawlout has their own unique playstyle, catering   |
  |   to specific character archetypes seen in other fighters. Whether      |
  |   you're a die-hard grappler or a rushdown fiend, there is a fighter    |
  |   for you in Brawlout.                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   There are currently six original characters and two popular indie     |
  |   characters to choose from that allow for varied play styles. As       |
  |   well as cosmetic skins, each original Brawlout character has three    |
  |   Variants; alt versions of the character with different stats,         |
  |   outfits and even new moves. With these Variants, Brawlout's cast      |
  |   numbers 18 individual fighters. Find the fighter and Variant that's   |
  |   right for you and tear it up on the battlefield.                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Combined with familiar movement techniques like wavedashing and       |
  |   airdodging, Brawlout adds some extra mechanics seen in other          |
  |   fighting games. The Rage Meter builds up as you both deal and take    |
  |   damage, allowing you either break combos with the Rage Burst or       |
  |   unleash hell with the Rage Mode. The Rage Burst pushes opponents      |
  |   back, breaking their combos and allowing players to create some       |
  |   breathing room at the cost of half their Rage Meter. If the meter     |
  |   fills, you can activate the Rage Mode, increasing the knockback you   |
  |   deal while reducing the amount you take.                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   As for modes, Brawlout has all you'd expect from a normal platform    |
  |   fighter and then some. Up to four players can compete in either       |
  |   timed, stock or team battles:                                         |
